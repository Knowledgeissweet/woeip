===========================================================================

West Oakland Air Quality (WOAQ) is a project of [OpenOakland](https://www.openoakland.org/) focused on building digital advocacy tools around air quality data collected by volunteers and citizen scientists.

WOAQ partners with [West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project](https://www.woeip.org) (WOEIP), a community-based environmental justice organization that has been collecting air quality data for over a decade. WOEIP is dedicated to achieving healthy homes, healthy jobs and healthy neighborhoods for all who live, work, learn and play in West Oakland, California.
